# crc32c

This package exposes to Python the CRC32C algorithm implemented in the SSE 4.2
instruction set of Intel CPUs.

Because ``crc32c`` is in PyPI, you can install it with:

```
pip install crc32c
```

If your CPU doesn't support this instruciton, the package will fail to load
with an ``ImportError``.
